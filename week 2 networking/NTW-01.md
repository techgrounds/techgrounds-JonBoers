Introduction:
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a model primarily used for troubleshooting of telecommunication or computing systems.

The OSI stack has 7 layers, each representing a different component of network communications. Each layer has different protocols associated with it.

When troubleshooting an IT issue, you can use the OSI model as a reference point, by taking a bottom-up or a top-down approach. For example, you might start at layer 1 by checking if all cables are connected and all devices are turned on.

An alternative to the OSI model is the TCP/IP model. The TCP/IP model describes the standard on which the internet was built, so it is a more realistic model. OSI is generally more practical for troubleshooting purposes because of its extra layers, even if it isnâ€™t entirely accurate.

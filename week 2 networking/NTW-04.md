# [Counting in Binary and Hex]


Introduction:
You have probably already heard that a computer counts using zeros and ones. This is not technically true. A computer can only detect whether or not there is an electrical signal present. A signal is represented as a 1, the absence of electricity is represented as a 0. Because there’s only two options (0 and 1), this way of representing numbers is called binary.
One physical unit that can contain (or not contain) electricity is called a bit. One bit is represented by one digit in a binary number. For example, the binary number 1010 has 4 digits, so it has 4 bits.
8 bits together is called a byte. The highest possible decimal value of a byte is 255 (1111 1111).
That being said, it is entirely possible to count to any number, and make any calculation just using these two numbers. Binary is important to understand, because it is needed to understand how IP addresses and subnets work.

Most human languages use a decimal system to represent numbers. Decimal means there’s 10 options or symbols to represent a number (0-9). If you start counting from 0, you eventually run out of symbols to use (at 9), so you have to add another digit (10).
Binary works in the same way. The only difference is that you run out of symbols very quickly (at 1), so you have to add a new digit (10) to represent the binary number 2.

Instead of subtracting symbols like in binary, you can also add symbols. This happens in the hexadecimal counting system (16 digits, represented as 0-f). You only need to add a digit after f (15 in decimal), so the hex number 10 equals the decimal number 16.
Hexadecimal numbers appear in IPv6, but also in most colour pickers (try to make a custom text colour in Google Docs for example).
Hex is useful because the highest value possible with 2 digits (ff) is 255, which is the same as the highest value of a byte.

The number of symbols available in a counting system is also known as the base. Binary is base 2, decimal is base 10, and hexadecimal is base 16
There are many tools and charts that will do the hard work for you when you’re actually working with these numbers, but for this exercise only, please try to do the calculations manually.
